# TIT College Websiste


I developed TIT Techoncrats Group of Institue of Technology  a college website project using React.js, aiming to enhance my web development skills. This project was a hands-on experience that helped me refine my front-end abilities, including working with components. I focused on creating a responsive, user-friendly design that mirrors the original site's layout and functionality. It was an excellent opportunity to practice building scalable applications and improve my understanding of React's core concepts. The project not only boosted my technical skills but also gave me the confidence to create polished, functional, and visually appealing websites.
